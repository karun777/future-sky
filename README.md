# 🌌 Future Sky

**Future Sky** is an open-source, lore-rich, and narrative-driven multiplayer RPG set across multiple timelines and dimensions. Inspired by classic MUDs like MajorMUD, cosmic metaphysics, and asynchronous worldbuilding, it invites players to explore a poetic sci-fi world — not through conquest, but through curiosity, resonance, and myth.

> *"The world was not built in code. The code came after. But the code remembers."*

## ✨ The Premise

A mysterious object — **the Cube** — launched in prehistory, has returned. It distorts time. Memories leak across eras. Entire timelines merge and unravel.

You awaken in **Triton Central**, a city under glass on Neptune’s moon, where human and alien drifters coexist in art, ruin, and riddles. Portals open to the **Jyotzon Era** (prehistoric Earth), the **Omnicron Era** (a collapsing present), and the **Manzo Era** (a quantum-powered future).

Each player is a ripple in this cosmic song — guided by astrological birth charts, chakra-aligned mana, and storylines shaped by collective imagination.

## 🌍 IRL Questing & Geocaching

Future Sky features a unique system of **real-world integration**, allowing players to engage with physical locations, artifacts, and coded quests:

- 🌐 **IRL Nodes**: Special places in the physical world linked to in-game locations
- 🧭 **QRs of Commotion**: Real-world QR codes players scan to unlock lore, items, or secret rooms
- 🌀 **Remote Participation**: Players who can't travel physically can still participate via astral projection, resonance quests, or buddy systems

Our first node is anchored at **Neptune Lounge – O'Connor, WA**, connected to the in-game Neptune Lounge.

Use `!scan_token TOKEN_CODE` in Discord to activate real-world links.
