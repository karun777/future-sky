## 🌐 IRL Architecture Contributions

We're building a global web of **IRL nodes** linked to in-game experiences. You can help by:

- Setting up geocaching-style quest locations in your area
- Placing QR tokens or symbolic items at meaningful places
- Linking these to rooms, items, or NPCs in the Future Sky world
- Creating lore and quest hooks for remote and local players

To propose an IRL node, submit an issue with:
- Real-world location name and coordinates
- Suggested token code and QR phrase
- Associated room or quest in-game
