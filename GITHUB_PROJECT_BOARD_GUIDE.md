# 🗂️ GitHub Project Board Setup for Future Sky

To organize collaborative development and track progress, you can set up a GitHub Project board:

## ✅ Steps to Set Up

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click on the **Projects** tab
3. Choose **“New project”**
4. Name it something like `Future Sky Dev Roadmap`
5. Select **Board view** (like Trello)
6. Add columns such as:
   - `🌱 Ideas`
   - `🛠️ In Progress`
   - `🧪 Needs Testing`
   - `✅ Complete`

## 📌 Card Types

Drag and drop issues and PRs into the board or create cards for:
- Lore writing tasks
- Room design and expansions
- Bot features
- Bugs or tech debt
- Media contributions

## 🌀 Use It Like a Cosmos Map

Think of the board as the Cube's interface — a meta-layer for guiding co-creation across timelines.
